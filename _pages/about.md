I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University, expected to graduate in December 2024. My current research interests primarily focus on Self-supervised, Unsupervised and Weakly supervised approaches for computer vision tasks. I'm also intrigued by the analysis of learned embedding spaces in Language Models, which I explore in my free time.

Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant under [Prof. Lee A. Cooper](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/cooper-lee.html) at Northwestern University's [Computational and Integrative Pathology Group](https://www.pathdata.io/), focusing on Panoptic Segmentation of histopathological images. For the summer, I'm interning at Johns Hopkins University under [Prof. Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/) at the [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning (CCVL) lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/), exploring Hyperbolic Deep Learning in Computer Vision.

Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechatronics Engineering with a minor in Computing from Manipal Institute of Technology, India. During my undergraduate years, I worked with [Prof. Biplab Banerjee](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/) at the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay, focusing on meta learning for super resolution and domain adaptive few shot learning.

During my undergraduate years, I was an active member of [AeroMIT](https://www.aeromit.in/), a multidisciplinary aerial robotics team at Manipal Institute of Technology. As part of this student project, I led efforts in applying deep learning techniques to autonomous UAVs.
