I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University, graduating in December 2024. My primary research area is computer vision, with a keen interest in multimodal research. I focus on developing robust and generalizable representations for computer vision and adjacent modalities, including but not limited to self-supervised learning, representation learning, unsupervised learning, and meta-learning.

This past summer, I worked as a visiting graduate student at Johns Hopkins University under [Prof. Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/) at the [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning (CCVL) lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/), working on hyperbolic deep learning in computer vision. At Northwestern, I am a Research Assistant under [Prof. Lee A. Cooper](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/cooper-lee.html) at the [Computational and Integrative Pathology Group](https://www.pathdata.io/), focusing on panoptic segmentation of histopathological images.

I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechatronics Engineering with a minor in Computing from Manipal Institute of Technology, India. During my bachelor's, I worked with [Prof. Biplab Banerjee](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/) at the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay on meta learning for super resolution and domain adaptive few shot learning. I was also an active member of [AeroMIT](https://www.aeromit.in/), a multidisciplinary aerial robotics team at Manipal Institute of Technology, where I led the Autonomous Drone Research subsystem.

In addition to my research, I am actively working on Multi-Agent Systems. In my free time, I also like to contribute to [HistomicsTK](https://github.com/DigitalSlideArchive/HistomicsTK) and analyze learned embedding spaces of language models.
